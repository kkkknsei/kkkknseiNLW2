Next Level Week #2 from Rocketseat


This repository was made for showing the website developed with the Rocketseat community through a week while learning how to use Javascript (and Node.js) to build a web application.

This current version is finished only on its core, there are certain things that can be improved (as always, you might know) but for now I'll leave it rest and keep on developing and studying other things before going back to it.
